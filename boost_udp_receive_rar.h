// A really simple option-free wrapper around the boost::asio stuff for
// synchronous and asynchronous reception of UDP datagrams. Ease of
// use is prioritised over flexible options - if flexibility is required, 
// then just use the boost::asio functionality directly!
//
// The socket is opened & bound, and a buffer (~65KB) is allocated
// as soon as an object of this class is created. To keep things simple
// some data copies are performed.
//
// This class is not thread safe and should only be used from a single thread
//
// Receive and Rejoice! (RAR)
//
// Synopsis:

	// interface.  As always with UDP and non-standard ports
